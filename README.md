# A Chip 8 emulator in C++

the implementation of the emulator was done following the [guide](http://devernay.free.fr/hacks/chip8/C8TECH10.HTM#00E0) 

## General structure
It is similar in structure to my other chip 8 emulator that is written in rust, the idea was to test the new features of C++

## Usage 

You need to have intalled the SDL2 and SDL2_image packages in order to compile it, Then just run 'make' in the root directory and will produce the executable in a build folder. Finally just run .build/ac8c [path_to_the_Rom].
